# Payment System Updates - Integration with Bookings

## Overview
The payment system has been restructured to integrate payments directly into the current bookings flow, and service history now includes bill generation with automatic printing functionality.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Payment Integration in Bookings âœ…
**What Changed:**
- Payments are now handled directly within the BookingList and BookingHistory components
- Removed separate "Payments Received" page for service providers
- Updated navigation to point service providers to "Manage Bookings" instead

**Benefits:**
- More intuitive workflow - payments happen where bookings are managed
- Consolidated interface reduces navigation complexity
- Better user experience with everything in one place

### 2. Bill Generation for Service History âœ…
**What Added:**
- New `Bill.tsx` component that generates printable invoices
- "View Bill" button appears for all paid bookings in service history
- Bills open in a new tab and automatically trigger print dialog

**Features:**
- Professional invoice layout with company branding
- Detailed service information and payment breakdown
- Tax calculation (10% service tax)
- Payment method tracking
- Customer and service provider details

### 3. Automatic Print Functionality âœ…
**How It Works:**
- Bills open in new browser tab (`/bill/:bookingId`)
- Page automatically triggers `window.print()` after content loads
- Print-optimized CSS styling
- Screen controls for manual print and window close

### 4. Backend API Enhancement âœ…
**New Endpoint:**
- `GET /api/bookings/:bookingId` - Retrieves single booking with populated user details
- Used by the Bill component to fetch comprehensive booking data

## Updated User Flows

1. **View Service History** â†’ `BookingHistory.tsx`
2. **See paid bookings** â†’ Shows "âœ“ Payment Completed" status
3. **Click "View Bill"** â†’ Opens bill in new tab
4. **Bill auto-prints** â†’ User can print or close

### For Service Providers:
1. **Navigate to "Manage Bookings"** â†’ `BookingList.tsx` 
2. **Handle payment confirmations** â†’ Confirm bank transfers, view receipts
3. **Process payments** â†’ All payment functionality in bookings interface

## File Changes
